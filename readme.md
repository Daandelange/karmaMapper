**Update 10-10-2020**
It's been fun and I've learned a lot. This project has become bigger than expected and needs refactoring.
As of 2020, I've archived karmaMapper, and started merging parts of it with [Mosaic](https://github.com/d3cod3/Mosaic). Mosaic is very close to the initial karmaMapper ideology and I'll continue to research & put efforts into that project. Another alternative, if you're more interested in the mapping aspect of karmaMapper, could be [Splash](https://sat-metalab.gitlab.io/splash/).

# karmaMapper
________

karmaMapper is a collection of OpenSource 2D mapping software made for real-time interactions and digital image generation. Built upon the amazing [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) framework, it gives an interface between the physical and the digital. It comes with an SDK allowing you to easyly start coding effects and modules then intstanciate and parametrize them within a same virtual space.
If you're at ease with code, it's a perfect tool to start coding on physical surfaces using a video projector.

Runs on Mac and Linux and Windows (alpha). 

_In the future, karmaMapper will aim to facilitate the work of creative coders with a bunch of redundant code. It will also provide automatic variable assignment and animation to create a vast interconnected virtual and analog environment. Some of the code might be shared with videoDromm including a distant control interface._

## SETUP
#### Install
- [Install OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/)  
- Clone the karmaMapper project:  

	```bash
	cd /path/to/openFrmeworks/apps/  
	mkdir karmaApps && cd ./karmaApps  
	git clone https://github.com/Karma-Kusala/karmaMapper.git --recursive   
	```
- Install dependencies: `cd ./karmaMapper && ./clone_addons.sh`  
_Note: On Windows, run the commands in the git command prompt._

#### Compile
_(Choose one)_  

- **Makefiles**: ( _/!\ Not tested with current build_ )  
`cd OF/apps/karmaApps/karmaMapper`  
`make Release`  
`make RunRelease`   
Select the animator or the editor in `config.make`  
	- `PROJECT_DEFINES = KM_EDITOR_APP`
	- `PROJECT_DEFINES = KM_ANIMATOR_APP`  
	
 _Note: Mac only. You may have to rename the `.mm`/`.m` file extensions in the addons' `ofxUVC/src/` to `.cpp`_
  
- **Qt Creator**: ( _/!\ Not tested with current build_ )  
Open `karmaMapper.qbs` and compile.  
See also the [OF Qt setup guide](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/qtcreator/).  
On Linux I also had to [update gcc to version 4.9](http://askubuntu.com/questions/428198/getting-installing-gcc-g-4-9-on-ubuntu).  
To select a **target**, edit `karmaMapper.qbs` and look for `of.defines: ['KM_ANIMATOR_APP']`  

- **Xcode**:  
Open `karmaMapper.xcodeproj` and select either the `karmaMapper Editor` or `karmaMapper Animator` target.  

	[__osx 10.12+ only__] : [Apple has kicked out the QTKit framework from 10.12+](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/macos-10-12-sierra-xcode-8-quicktime-deprecation-workaround/24179), needed by karmaMapper. For now, use `MacOSX10.9.sdk` (or 10.11).  
	- [Download an SDK](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/releases/tag/MacOSX10.11.sdk)  
	- Install via symlink: (you can also copy the file into Xcode)  
`sudo ln -s /path/to/MacOSX10.11.sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs`  
	- Relaunch Xcode then select the right SDKs to use to build and link karmaMapper and OF on each target in your project settings.

- **Visual Studio**: ( _/!\ Not tested with current build_ )  
Open `karmaMapper.vcxproj` and compile. If not compiling, it may help to re-generate the project using OpenFramework's Project Generator.

#### Optional:
Some [extra standalone apps](https://github.com/Karma-Kusala/karmaMapper/tree/master/utilities/) are available on rpi and other platforms, they can connect to and interact with karmaMapper.

- **RaspberryPi + Raspbian**: ( _/!\ Not tested with current build_ )  
Various scripts will be available, so an Rpi will be useful to have around.
[Pd sound analyser](https://github.com/Karma-Kusala/karmaMapper/tree/master/utilities/karmaSoundAnalyser) - [Pd Chladni plate generator](https://github.com/Karma-Kusala/karmaMapper/tree/master/utilities/chladni-plate-generator)
Note: I also got the karmaMapper (renderer) to compile and run on a RaspberryPi2 using Raspbian. Not sure the current version still compiles.
- **Arduino**  
A [serial control interface](https://github.com/Karma-Kusala/karmaMapper/tree/master/src/modules/serialController_v1) is available to communicate with Arduinos over USB / Serial.
