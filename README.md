# karmaMapper

Being coded...  
Under Construction...

# Details
I started coding a custom mapping software for various purposes. I'll commit updates from time to time.  
I'm planning to maintain and continue this piece of software; feel free to contribute.  

Any comments, feature discussions or contributions are welcome.  

#### Current features:  
- __realWorldInterface__ :  
_Lets you map virtual shapes to real world coordinates._  
_The virtual shapes are then shared with other app components such as effect generators._  
- __More to come...__ :
