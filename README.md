Being coded...

# Details
This is the beginning of a complete custom mapping software. I'll commit updates from time to time.  
I'm planning to maintain and continue this piece of software; feel free to contribute.  

#### Current features:  
- __realWorldInterface__ :  
_Lets you map virtual shapes to real world coordinates._  
_The virtual shapes are then shared with other app components such as effect generators._  
- _More to come..._ :
